## Introduction
The Export Planning Tool is a powerful and user-friendly MERN stack application designed to assist warehouse managers in streamlining the process of estimating the required number of trailers at the time of receiving an order. With the increasing demand for faster deliveries, it is crucial for warehouses to accurately predict the number of trailers needed to distribute their stock efficiently. However, predicting the number of trailers before the warehouse order has been fully picked and the number of pallets available can be challenging.

Our app utilizes historical data to provide accurate estimates based on the average of the five previous weeks, or specific days of the week. With the app's intuitive charts and graphs, you can easily identify seasonal order spikes and be prepared for the growing demand. The application is designed to be simple and easy to use, allowing warehouse managers to make better-informed decisions and improve overall efficiency.
