<h2>What is this App for..</h2>
Some of the warehouses hiring other logistic companies to distribute the stock.
To speed up deliveries it is beneficial to request trailers as soon as the warehouse received the order. However,
it is very difficult to predict the number of trailers before the warehouse order has been fully picked and the number of pallets available. 
There is always a risk to request too many or not enough trailers to distribute in full.
Export Planning Tool is a MERN stack Application designed to simplify the process of estimating the required number of trailers according to the demand of cases.
All estimates are based on the average of the five previous weeks, or specific days of the week. With app charts, you can easily identify seasonal order spikes, 
and prepare for the growing demand.<a href="https://guarded-savannah-03210.herokuapp.com"/>See Demo</a>
